# Event Owners Guide

This section covers how to create, manage, and run a Jam event.

## Creating events

You must be logged in to the Jam admin console. If you do not see the **Host** menu then your account has not been assigned the event creator role. If you are an Amazonian, you will have event creator access and will not need to request access. If you are external to Amazon, you need to have a current Skill Builder team subscription.

**IMPORTANT***: A Jam learner must be a Skill Builder Team Subscriber in order to participate in a Jam event.*

## How to schedule a custom Jam event

You would schedule a custom Jam event if you want to choose specific challenges for your own unique Jam event. This process has six steps: *Event details*, *Attendance and Testing*, *Team Assignment Settings*, *Owners and Permissions*, *Challenges*, and *Review and Create*.

## *Step 2 Attendance and Testing (How to set the number of participants and team size)*

The *Attendance and Testing* page is displayed. This second step is where you configure your estimated number of participants and the team size. Your estimate should be as accurate as possible. Also, this is where you choose if this is a live event or test event.

Participants will also have the option to create a new team or create and join a password protected team with their peers.
	- b. **Skill-based**: Participants will be grouped into teams based on their selfreported skill level and will not be able to choose or create teams. An event facilitator must initiate the team assignment and compose teams with either similar or diverse skill levels.

An event owner must create teams in advance from the Participants section on this page as participants will not be able to create new teams. > **📝 Note:** This cannot be done until after this event has been approved.

![](images/_page_17_Figure_1.jpeg)

2. In *Team Size* enter a number of participants per team. > **📝 Note:** Keep the size limits between 3 and 6 participants. Anything outside the limits could delay the approval of the event.

![](images/_page_18_Picture_2.jpeg)

## *Step 4 Owners and Permissions (How to add owners and permissions)*

The *Owners and Permissions* page is displayed. This fourth step is where you can add event team members and set permissions. This is also where you can enable messaging between facilitators and participants, enable chat support, and enable team members chat and create meetings.

![](images/_page_18_Figure_6.jpeg)

In the input field enter the **email address** of the user you want to add to the event, then select **Add**.

2. The *Permissions* section shows all event team members you have added to the event and their permissions. You can select a member's permissions by toggling **on** the role that is in the same row as their email. To remove a user choose **X** on the users **row**. > **📝 Note:** The original event owner has all three roles by default and cannot be removed. You can choose only one role per member. The order of permissions from most to least is: *Event Owner*, *Facilitator*, and *Support*. When you choose a role, the user gets all of permissions below that also. For example if you choose the *Facilitator* that member also gets *Support* permissions.

![](images/_page_19_Figure_3.jpeg)

3. The *Support and Collaboration* section is where you enable the support and team collaboration using chat and meetings. You can enable/disable the following based on your event requirements:
	- a. **Support Chat**: This option is disabled by default. If this option is enabled, participants can request a chat with a support member. > **📝 Note:** For virtual events we recommend enabling the chat support option. This enables facilitators to provide support virtually. Only enable this option is there is an event team member dedicated to monitoring the support chat queue.

	- b. `**:**` **Contains**. This operator is used to find a string of text that is found anywhere in the challenge property.

![](images/_page_22_Figure_5.jpeg)

Type the text after the operator and it will automatically update with a list of challenges that are available. If the list is empty, start your search over this time using new search terms. If the challenge list is empty again, the challenge probably does not exist. > **📝 Note:** In this example the word "*lost*" is searched within **Title** of all the challenges with the `**:**` **Contains** operator.
