# Jam Overview

--8<-- "source-notice-en.md"

AWS Jam is an immersive experiential learning platform that helps learners develop the skills to build on the AWS Cloud through simulated real-world use-cases. Learners form teams to solve a series of challenges and engage in friendly competition to get the top position on the leaderboard. AWS Jam delivers an engaging experience through several gaming elements such as collaboration, competition, real-time scoring, and relevant in-scenario clues. Learners can get their hands dirty with 200+ challenges on topics such as security, DevOps, AI/ML, data analytics, migration tooling, serverless, application modernization, IoT, and more.

AWS Jam not only has the ability to identify whether the goals were achieved, but can also programmatically validate that the solution implements best practices that are known to scale effectively. This ensures that participants are learning established best practices which can then be taken back and implemented within their organizations.

## How AWS Jam works

AWS Jam challenges individuals and teams to apply their AWS Cloud skills to solve real-world, open-ended problems using AWS services. Engage in a gamified learning environment that helps you develop your AWS Cloud skills through simulated use cases in an AWS Management Console sandbox. Select challenges by technical domain or role and by difficulty level. Clues are available to help navigate the challenges if needed.

## Definitions

AWS Jam

- **Event**: A learning experience that is scheduled and time bound. During an event teams of participants attempt to solve a set of challenges (1-14) within an allotted time and compete against other teams to score the highest points.

- **Event owner**: The event owner is person responsible for planning, configuring the event parameters, selecting the challenges, hosting the live event, and reviewing the event statistics.
- **Experience**: A pre-configured event that contains a set of challenges. The challenges within an experience are typically aligned to the experience scenario theme and technical domain.
- **Campaign**: This is a type of Jam event that runs over multiple days. The challenges can be solved over a period of time.
- **Challenge**: A challenge is a key component of an event. It is a problem scenario that relates to common use cases, domains, and roles.
- **Challenge set**: A curated set of challenges that can be used to quickly add to an event during planning.

participants. They may also help participants answer questions during the challenge solution session and solve technical issues.

- **Participant**: A participant is someone that takes part in an event to attempt to solve challenges as a team. A participant is invited by the event owner to take part in a live event with multiple participants. A participant may take part in an on demand event by themselves.
