# Event Owners Guide

--8<-- "source-notice-en.md"

This section covers how to create, manage, and run a Jam event.

## Creating events

You must be logged in to the Jam admin console. If you do not see the **Host** menu then your account has not been assigned the event creator role. If you are an Amazonian, you will have event creator access and will not need to request access. If you are external to Amazon, you need to have a current Skill Builder team subscription.

**IMPORTANT***: A Jam learner must be a Skill Builder Team Subscriber in order to participate in a Jam event.*

## Guide Sections

This guide is divided into several sections to help you navigate through different aspects of event management:

- **[Creating Events](creating-events.md)** - Learn how to schedule and configure custom Jam events
- **[Managing Events](managing-events.md)** - How to manage, modify, and monitor your existing events
- **[Managing Participants](participants.md)** - How to invite and manage event participants

Each section provides step-by-step instructions with screenshots to guide you through the process.
