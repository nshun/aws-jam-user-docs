5. When done entering event details, choose **Next**.

## *Step 2 Attendance and Testing (How to set the number of participants and team size)*

The *Attendance and Testing* page is displayed. This second step is where you configure your estimated number of participants and the team size. Your estimate should be as accurate as possible. Also, this is where you choose if this is a live event or test event.

**IMPORTANT***: A Jam learner must be a Skill Builder Team Subscriber in order to participate in a Jam event.*

![](../../images/_page_15_Figure_4.jpeg)

1. In the *Attendance* panel complete the following:
	- a. **Number of expected participants**: Enter the lowest **number** of participants you expect and the higher **number** of total participants. > **📝 Note:** A number above 100 participants will require a manual approval.
	- b. **Team size**: Enter a number of participants per team. > **📝 Note:** Keep the size limits between 3 and 6 participants. Anything outside the limits could delay the approval of the event.

![](../../images/_page_15_Figure_8.jpeg)

3. When done with Attendance and Testing details, choose **Next**.

## *Step 3 Team Assignment Settings (How to configure team settings)*

The *Team Assignment Settings* page is displayed. This third step is where you configure how teams are formed, the team size, when teams can be formed, and if you want to allow team renaming.

![](../../images/_page_16_Figure_5.jpeg)

1. In the *Team Assignment Settings* panel choose one of the **Team Types**:
	- a. **Self-forming (Default)**: This option presents participants with system suggested team to join based on their self-reported skill level and their goal of play-to-win or play-to-learn. Participants will also have the option to create a new team or create and join a password protected team with their peers.
	- b. **Skill-based**: Participants will be grouped into teams based on their selfreported skill level and will not be able to choose or create teams. An event facilitator must initiate the team assignment and compose teams with either similar or diverse skill levels.
	- c. **Pre-created**: Use this option when instructing participants to join a specific team. An event owner must create teams in advance from the Participants section on this page as participants will not be able to create new teams. > **📝 Note:** This cannot be done until after this event has been approved.

![](../../images/_page_17_Figure_1.jpeg)

2. In *Team Size* enter a number of participants per team. > **📝 Note:** Keep the size limits between 3 and 6 participants. Anything outside the limits could delay the approval of the event.

![](../../images/_page_17_Figure_3.jpeg)

3. The *Team Forming Start Time* setting helps to reduce the number of participants who join a team and then forget to come back when the event starts. In **Teams cannot form until**, enter a **number** in minutes before the event start time.

![](../../images/_page_17_Figure_5.jpeg)

4. The *Team Name* setting controls the ability of the team owner to edit their team name anytime during the event and only applies to team owners. Facilitators will always be able to edit team names. To enable the changing of team names by the team owner **check** to **Allow team owner to rename team**.

![](../../images/_page_18_Picture_2.jpeg)

5. When done with *Team Assignment Settings*, choose **Next**.

## *Step 4 Owners and Permissions (How to add owners and permissions)*

The *Owners and Permissions* page is displayed. This fourth step is where you can add event team members and set permissions. This is also where you can enable messaging between facilitators and participants, enable chat support, and enable team members chat and create meetings.

![](../../images/_page_18_Figure_6.jpeg)

1. The *Owners and Permissions* panel used to add event team members and manage their permissions. In the input field enter the **email address** of the user you want to add to the event, then select **Add**. The added users will receive an email to verify their email address prior to joining the event.

![](../../images/_page_19_Figure_1.jpeg)

2. The *Permissions* section shows all event team members you have added to the event and their permissions. You can select a member's permissions by toggling **on** the role that is in the same row as their email. To remove a user choose **X** on the users **row**. > **📝 Note:** The original event owner has all three roles by default and cannot be removed. You can choose only one role per member. The order of permissions from most to least is: *Event Owner*, *Facilitator*, and *Support*. When you choose a role, the user gets all of permissions below that also. For example if you choose the *Facilitator* that member also gets *Support* permissions.

![](../../images/_page_19_Figure_3.jpeg)

3. The *Support and Collaboration* section is where you enable the support and team collaboration using chat and meetings. You can enable/disable the following based on your event requirements:
	- a. **Support Chat**: This option is disabled by default. If this option is enabled, participants can request a chat with a support member. > **📝 Note:** For virtual events we recommend enabling the chat support option. This enables facilitators to provide support virtually. Only enable this option is there is an event team member dedicated to monitoring the support chat queue.
	- b. **Team Chat**: This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, participants will not be able to start team chats/meetings with their team for the event.
	- c. **Facilitator Messaging**: This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, facilitators will not be able to send messages to teams and/or participants for the event.

![](../../images/_page_20_Figure_3.jpeg)

4. When done with *Owners and Permissions* settings, choose **Next**.

## *Step 5 Challenges (How to add challenges to an event)*

The *Challenges* page is displayed. In this fifth step, you choose what challenges you will have for participants to solve. You can choose it individually, use curated challenge sets, or use challenges from a past event.

![](../../images/_page_20_Picture_7.jpeg)

1. In the *Challenges* page the **I want to choose my own challenges** panel is maximized and shows the **Browse Challenges** panel, which is also maximized. Choose **Select challenges** to browse the challenge library and to pick challenges to use for your event.

![](../../images/_page_21_Figure_2.jpeg)

2. The *Select Challenges* panel shows the challenge library. To the right of the *Challenges* title the count of challenges you have chosen out of the available challenges to choose from the list below that. The count changes based on your filters. The **Hide unstable challenges** is enabled by default. You can **toggle on**/**of** this option to hide/show unstable challenges.

![](../../images/_page_21_Figure_4.jpeg)

3. Choose the *search* field without typing anything to show the *Properties* panel. You can filter challenges based on its properties. The available properties are the following: **Title**, **Status**, **Owner**, **Category**, **Difculty**, **AWS Service**, and **Tag**.

![](../../images/_page_22_Figure_1.jpeg)

4. Choose a property to show *Operators* which are used to find more specific challenges. You can choose between two operators as follows:
	- a. `**=**` **Equals**. This operator is used to find a string of text exactly as you typed in the challenge property.
	- b. `**:**` **Contains**. This operator is used to find a string of text that is found anywhere in the challenge property.

![](../../images/_page_22_Figure_5.jpeg)

Type the text after the operator and it will automatically update with a list of challenges that are available. If the list is empty, start your search over this time using new search terms. If the challenge list is empty again, the challenge probably does not exist. > **📝 Note:** In this example the word "*lost*" is searched within **Title** of all the challenges with the `**:**` **Contains** operator.

![](../../images/_page_22_Figure_7.jpeg)

The *Challenges* panel shows a list of challenges with your specific filters applied. If you want to add a challenge to the event, **check** the box to the left of the *challenge title*. The *Challenges* count is updated with the number of challenges selected from the available shown.

![](../../images/_page_23_Figure_4.jpeg)

You can narrow down challenges by applying additional filters in *search* in the *Challenges* panel of the *Select Challenges* section. In this example "*s3*" is typed and the value "*AWS Service = Amazon Simple Storage (S3)*" is chosen.

![](../../images/_page_24_Figure_1.jpeg)

You can change the filter logic of two or more *filters* by choosing **and**/**or** found on the left of a second **flter** and later filters. You can remove filters by choosing **X** to the right of each filter. > **📝 Note:** If your search returns empty, you can try improve your results by removing individual filters and/or changing the filter logic using **and/or** operators. Add a **check** next to the challenge name of the challenge(s) that you want to add.

![](../../images/_page_24_Figure_3.jpeg)

5. You can add backup challenges which are used in the event if a primary challenge has a problem deploying. Choose **Backup Challenges**, then choose **Add general backup challenges** to open the Select Challenges section and use the search challenge steps shown earlier to find backup challenges.

![](../../images/_page_25_Figure_1.jpeg)

6. You can also use challenge sets which are preset challenges to use to populate your selected challenges list. Choose **Challenge Sets**, then choose an **set** in the *Choose Challenge Set* dropdown.

![](../../images/_page_25_Figure_3.jpeg)

7. When you choose a challenge set, it will replace any previously selected challenges and will populate it with all the challenges belonging to the set. You can remove an individual challenge of the set by choosing **X**. You can add more challenges by choosing **Select more challenges**. You can remove the entire challenge set by choosing **X Remove** to the left of the challenge set name in the *Challenge Sets* panel.

![](../../images/_page_26_Figure_1.jpeg)

8. You can select challenges from a past event you hosted or participated in by choosing **Previous Events**. In *Search events* select a *Range Start* and *Range End* by entering a date in the format **YYYY/MM/DD** or choose **calendar icon** to pick a date. Then, choose an event in the *Choose Event* dropdown. > **📝 Note:** If no event shows up check the Range Start and Range End dates to make sure the past event falls between your chosen dates.

![](../../images/_page_27_Figure_1.jpeg)
